3. Entry should be clickable and should lead to HackerNews comments(link)
4. Implement mobile version which consists of entry title column only (fills screen completely) and has floating sort by date button
5. Make table adaptive: breakline entries, truncate by ellipsis any overflow that doesn't fit into 3 lines
6. **Optional** implement the same functionality for other list (news if you implemented newest, newest otherwise,etc.), add ability to transition between lists
